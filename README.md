**Version 2.0.2 BETA Release Candidate 2** (20.08.2018)

## What is WPSeed?
Planting trees? Why waste your time digging a hole each time when you can just plant a seed instead? Even better, you can use the same seed for every tree you're planting from now on. WPSeed is your blueprint for modern WordPress theme development.

Following the DRY principle, WPSeed comes with everything you'll need for 90% of your themes, but nothing more, keeping it clean and simple.


* A **clean workflow** including compiling, minifying, cachebusting and more.
* SASS-presets and configs with everything you really need, but nothing more. Including **an amazing responsive setup**, you'll love it.
* Functions that actually do stuff and will **make your dev-life a lot easier**.
* Templates and presets for stuff you'll need often. **WPSeed will make sure you [D.R.Y.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)**.
* 100% **Free**.


## Requirements:
  * Node >= 8.0 ([nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/))
  * npm >=5.0 (`npm install -g npm@latest` - [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/))
  * php >= 7.1 (Make sure [short_open_tag](http://php.net/manual/de/ini.core.php#ini.short-open-tag) is set to `true` on your VM/Webserver).

## Installation
* Clone WPSeed `$ git clone git@github.com:flurinduerst/WPSeed.git` into your `themes` directory.

## Workflow
#### General
* you can use any TLD for local development. WPSeed assumes you're using `.vm` for "virtual machine". If you want to use a different TLD make sure to change `.vm` to your preffered TLD in `Vagrantfile`, `gulpfile.js` and `functions-wpsetup.php`.

#### Gulp
WPSeed uses npm to manage development-modules aswell as frontend-modules and [gulp](https://gulpjs.com) to compile assets from `assets` to `dist`. For details see `gulpfile.js`.
  * Install gulp globally with `npm install -g gulp` if you haven't already
  * add your domain/ip to `browsersync_proxy` in `gulpfile.js`
  * in the theme directory run `npm install`
  * you can now use `gulp` to compile and optimize your asset files and run browsersync. Use `gulp watch` to let gulp compile your files automatically whenever you've made changes to the associated files.
  * gulp is handling vendor-requirements (external tools/frameworks) by additionally compiling/bundling the files defined in `gulp-vendors.json`. So, if you add vendors, make sure to add them to `gulp-vendors.json`.
  * for further information about gulp see [gulpjs.com](https://gulpjs.com/)

#### Modernizr
WPSeed uses [modernizr](https://modernizr.com/) to automatically detect the availability of next-generation web technologies.
  * install the modernizr [command line config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/modernizr) with `npm install -g modernizr`
  * create/download your custom modernizr config at [modernizr.com](https://modernizr.com/download?setclasses) and select the `command line config` download option. Move the downloaded `modernizr-config.json` into `assets/scripts`.
  * run `modernizr -c assets/scripts/modernizr-config.json -d assets/scripts` to generate your `modernizr.js`. This file will be compiled by gulp.
  * Note: If you don't want to use modernizr you can just ignore/delete the modernizr files in `assets/scripts/` Everything will work perfectly fine without them.
  * Add the class `modernizr-of` to every image you're using the object-fit class with. If the current browser does not support the `object-fit` attribute, all images with the class `modernizr-of` will be replaced with a div with the image-url set to background to ensure browser-compatability. Also make sure to add the background-position to the image so it can be use within the generated div.

## HTML Structure
In WPSeed the following semantical structure is used on every site:
``` html
<header>                        the page header containing the navigation and the logo
  <nav>                         the main navigation
<main>                          contains everything but navigation, footer and aside-elements
  <section>                     serves as a structural container and/or fullwidth-background
    <article>                   contains the content when the use of an article tag is semantically correct
    or
    <div class="element">       contains the content when using an article tag is semantically wrong
<footer>                        the page footer, can contain additional links and informations like address or logos
```

## Get Started
The first things you want to do (after setting up the workflow as explained above) when creating a new website using WPSeed:
* open `functions/functions-setup.php` and add your custom settings
* quickly check the other files in `/functions` to make sure it suits your needs
* open `assets/styles/vars.scss` and add your custom sizes, breakpoints, colors, and so on
* add your templates like `templates/temp-yourtemplate.php`
* add your acf-blocks in `functions-blocks.php` and create a template like `templates/temp-blocks-yourcustomblock`
* use the SASS files in `assets/styles` to add your custom css

For more detailed informations about all file-types, see "Important Files/Folders" below.

## Deployment
* when deploying your website using a deployment-environment like [deploybot](https://deploybot.com/) or [deployHQ](https://www.deployhq.com/) run
  * `npm install` to install the frontend-modules/vendors on the deployment-docker (`--no-spin` helps to keep the logfile clean)
  * `gulp` to compile assets
  * Note: the `npm_modules` folder is not needed on the webserver itself. Vendors from npm_modules are compiled into `style.min.css` and `script.min.js`.

## Usage

### General
* All important files provide a description/version at the top. Make sure to read it first.
* Since Version 1.2.0 WPSeed creates cache-busting using [gulp-rev](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-rev). If you're working locally (using the `.vm` TLD) the non-busted stylesheet (style.min.css) is enqueued, to make sure browsersync runs as expected.

### Important Files/Folders

##### Functions
```
functions-blocks.php      functions to output ACFs flexible blocks (called "blocks" in WPSeed)
functions-custom.php      space for your own, custom functions, for example shortcodes
functions-dev.php         functions used for development purposes
functions-settings.php    theme-settings and general functions that normally don't need much editing
functions-setup.php       the starting point for setting up a new theme, this is where the basic settings are located
```

##### CSS
```
assets/styles/bundle.scss       gathers all .scss files for compiling with gulp
assets/styles/content.scss      content related styles
assets/styles/essentials.scss   required SASS functions and all presets for responsive
assets/styles/general.scss      re-usable classes and settings
assets/styles/fonts.scss        locally hosted fonts
assets/styles/nav.scss          navigation
assets/styles/vars.scss         manages scaling, all colors, fonts and other presets
```

##### Javascript
```
assets/scrips/essentials.js   re-usable essential javascript/jQuery functions/variables
assets/scrips/functions.js    javascript/jQuery
modernizr-config.json         Modernizr configuration, see the "Modernizr" section above
modernizr.js                  Modernizr modules, see the "Modernizr" section above
```

##### Templates
The Wordpress default templates (like page.php, single.php) receive their content from the associated file inside the template folder. This way all templates are grouped together. `index.php` is forwarded to `page.php`.

All templates are seperated into two categories recognizable by their prefix:
* **`temp`**: individual site templates.
* **`wp`**: wordpress default templates.

```
temp-blocks.php         loads the acf-blocks (using the "Flexible Element" field-type) from `functions-blocks.php`
temp-blocks-***.php     loads your custom acf-block and shows its content (see the example `temp-blocks-article`)
temp-home.php           displays default content and a full width teaser image
temp-subsites.php       displays default content and content of the respective child pages
wp-home.php             WP blog default
wp-page.php             WP page default
wp-single.php           WP post default
```


### Responsive/Fluid presets

#### Scaling
By default, the layout will scale with the viewport-width as all units are `rem` based and `html` uses font-size as the root unit.
This scaling can be configured at the `SIZE/SCALING` section in `vars.scss`. It is also possible to stop the scaling at a certain viewport-width. See instructions inside `vars.scss`.

#### Mixins/Classes
**defined by variables**
* The width of the two available variables `mobile` and `desktop` are defined in vars.scss. Usage (with default values):
* min 800px `@include desktop {...}`
* max 799px`@include mobile {...}`

**defined by individual pixel widths**
* at least 750px: `@include vpw_min(750px)`
* at most 500px: `@include vpw_max(500px)`
* between 1000px and 1200px: `vpw(1000px, 1200px)`

**defined by ascepct-ratio**
* at least 16:9: `@include asr_min(16,9) { ... }`
* at most 4:3: `@include asr_max(4,3) { ... }`

**defined by css-class**
the two available classes `mobile` and `desktop` perform as followed (with default values):
```SCSS
.desktop {
	// hidden while < 800px;
}
.mobile {
	// hidden while > 799;
}
```
